JavaSysMon - Maven edition
==========================

This is a fork of Jez Humble's [JavaSysMon](https://github.com/jezhumble/javasysmon)

This fork exists just to make it easy to include in Java projects. Just add the following dependency:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.danielflower.apprunner</groupId>
		<artifactId>javasysmon</artifactId>
		<version>0.3.5.0</version>
	</dependency>

Update
------

It's no longer just a fork. Now with new feature:
